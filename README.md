# Two-stage-OTA-design-and-layout-130nm

## Project Summary
This personal project implements a two-stage operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) and aims to meet pre-determined design specification. It demonstrates how an OTA works, what MOSFETs are capable of achieving, and the importance of MOSFET devices in modern VLSI and mixed-signal applications. The documents showcase screenshots which depict the actual schematics, testbenches, simulations, and layouts captured throughout the project (download to view full documents on phone).

## Tools Used
- Ubuntu
- Sky130 130nm 1.8V PMOS

## Design Goals Reached:

1. Two amplification stages

2. Achieve AC gain of 60-70dB

4. Operating frequency up to 1MHz (MHz-level GBW)

5. Slew rate greater than 5V/us

6. Total current consumption less than 300uA
